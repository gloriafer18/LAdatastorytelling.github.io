## Workshop Program

This workshop is organised as follows:

### Contextualising existing methods and methodologies for DS: 1 hours

In the first activity of this workshop the organisers will introduce current work on DS in LA and 
other research fields such as Information Visualisation and Human-Centered Design. After the 
initial opening presentation, we will encourage active participation in small groups for 
participants to share their perceptions and motivations in terms of the existing DS research and 
what challenges and opportunities they foresee. 


### Methods and Methodologies for DS in LA Dashboards: 2 hours 

This workshop activity will include 5-minute presentations of current methodological and technical 
approaches of the use of DS to improve LA interfaces submitted to this workshop (in the form of 
short papers). Each presenter will explain their technical or methodological approaches and 
indicate the challenges they have faced running their studies. A variety of research will be 
welcome during these sessions including: uses or definitions of DS frameworks for LA, studies 
evaluating LA interfaces enhanced with DS, technical approaches to implementing DS-based LA 
dashboards and interfaces, or work in progress in general (e.g., LA Dashboards or visual interfaces 
prototypes using DS).

### Reflections and Roadmap: 1 hour

The last part of the workshop will focus on reflecting on the work presented during the session and 
defining strategies to increase active use of DS in LA research and design practices. As a result 
of this session, a list of challenges and opportunities will be identified and used to co-create a 
roadmap to define priorities and main challenges for the DS LA community.
