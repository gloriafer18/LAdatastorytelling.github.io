## Call for papers

This workshop aims to explore methodological (formal and practical) approaches to actively increase 
DS adoption and impact in the LA community. Thus, this workshop will provide a scenario for 
participants to reflect and critically discuss the following aspects:  What methods and 
methodologies of DS from other domains are suitable for LA? How can researchers effectively 
evaluate the impact of DS in LA? How can we automate the process of generating fair and unbiased 
data stories? To start, the organisers of the workshop will provide a review of lessons learnt from 
using DS to support stakeholdersâ€™ interpretations of visual interfaces from the current literature 
in LA and other research fields such as Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI). This review will be a starting point to open the discussion with participants 
regarding challenges (e.g., automate DS according to particular needs) and opportunities (e.g., the 
use of AI to generate narratives to support interpretations) of DS to effectively support 
educational stakeholders to make sense of their data traces and make them actionable to improve 
their practice.
