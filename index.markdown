# Converging Data Storytelling Narratives and Learning Analytics Dashboards

### Workshop abstract:

Data Storytelling (DS) in Learning Analytics (LA) has proven as an effective approach to 
communicating insights to non-data experts (e.g., students and teachers). DS brings the promise to 
incorporate narratives into LA interfaces (e.g., dashboards) to facilitate the provision of direct 
feedback and pedagogical explanations. The LA community has researched Data Storytelling principles 
and techniques to support educational stakeholders in interpreting their teaching and learning 
progress. However, given the relevance of the story narrative, challenges arise to provide 
unbiased, fair, and meaningful stories without misleading the communication of insights. 

### Workshop Goals

This workshop aims to explore the formal and practical challenges and opportunities of DS by engaging in 
discussions with the LA community. In this workshop, we expect to spark discussion on these main 
topics: What methods and methodologies of DS from other domains are suitable for LA? How to 
evaluate the impact of DS in LA? How can we automate the process of generating fair and unbiased 
data stories to facilitate sense-making and effectively communicate insights? This workshop will 
bring together storytelling researchers and practitioners, whose data storytelling in LA is a 
special case, to clarify and converge on the future of DS in LA related to their challenges and 
opportunities.
