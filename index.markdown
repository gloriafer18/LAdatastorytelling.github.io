# Converging Data Storytelling Narratives and Learning Analytics Dashboards

### Workshop abstract:

Data Storytelling (DS) in Learning Analytics (LA) has proven as an effective approach to 
communicating insights to non-data experts (e.g., students and teachers). DS brings the promise to 
incorporate narratives into LA interfaces (e.g., dashboards) to facilitate the provision of direct 
feedback and pedagogical explanations. The LA community has researched Data Storytelling principles 
and techniques to support educational stakeholders in interpreting their teaching and learning 
progress. However, given the relevance of the story narrative, challenges arise to provide 
unbiased, fair, and meaningful stories without misleading the communication of insights. 

### Workshop Goals

This workshop aims to explore the formal and practical challenges and opportunities of DS by engaging in 
discussions with the LA community. In this workshop, we expect to spark discussion on these main 
topics: What methods and methodologies of DS from other domains are suitable for LA? How to 
evaluate the impact of DS in LA? How can we automate the process of generating fair and unbiased 
data stories to facilitate sense-making and effectively communicate insights? This workshop will 
bring together storytelling researchers and practitioners, whose data storytelling in LA is a 
special case, to clarify and converge on the future of DS in LA related to their challenges and 
opportunities.

### Background

There is a growing interest in creating Learning Analytics (LA) interfaces (e.g., dashboards, visualizations, or reports) to support educational stakeholders in monitoring learning tasks (Salas-Pilco et al., 2022). However, recent literature reviews and empirical studies report that most of these LA interfaces have serious limitations, such as showing visualizations that are difficult to understand by non data experts (Corrin & de Barba, 2015; Herodotou et al., 2019), lack of effectiveness in communicating insights (Bodily et al., 2017), and failing to align with educators’ pedagogical needs (Kaliisa et al., 2022; Sergis et al., 2017). 

Commonly current research and design approaches adopted to create LA interfaces are generating interfaces that are often hard to interpret in a timely manner (Duval, 2011). With the increasing amount of complex data traces captured (in online and physical spaces), there is a need for compelling ways to distill information into meaningful, memorable, and engaging insights (Dominyk, 2022). One of the strategies to address these challenges is the improvement of the explanatory design features of current LA interfaces. Data storytelling (DS) techniques and principles provide a way to include narrative and elements to explain and connect the learning design goals with visual elements aiming at guiding the user's attention to relevant insights. For instance, Echeverria et al. (2018) demonstrated the potential of enhancing visualisations with DS visual elements (e.g., title, highlights, shaded areas) in helping teachers explore visualisations with less effort. Similarly, Martinez-Maldonado et al. (2020) demonstrated the promise of using a layered storytelling approach to communicate insights on team performance. Following a similar layered approach, Fernandez-Nieto et al. (2021) crafted data stories to promote students' reflections. Their work demonstrated that learner data stories were useful for students to identify potential improvements and errors they performed while enacting clinical simulations. One of the most recent works on DS is presented by Pozdniakov et al. (2023). The authors evaluated the impact of teachers’ visualisation literacy on their interactions with LA dashboards, and found that teachers with low visualisation literacy especially benefited from DS-based visual guidance. While these prior works have demonstrated how DS can benefit teachers and students when interpreting data from LA interfaces, there are still challenges and opportunities to explore in terms of DS automation, ethics, fairness, scalability, and impact (Fernandez-Nieto et al., 2021; Martinez-Maldonado et al., 2020; Zdanovic et al., 2022).
